```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library (tidyverse)
```


```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
data(nyc_airbnb)

nyc_airbnb

```

```{r}
str(nyc_airbnb)

nyc_airbnb %>%
  count(room_type)

nyc_airbnb %>%
  count(neighbourhood_group)
```

Does rating vary by neighborhood? 

```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(neighbourhood_group, review_scores_location) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = neighbourhood_group, y = review_scores_location, color = neighbourhood_group)) + geom_boxplot()
```
Median price 


```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  group_by(neighbourhood_group, room_type) %>% 
  summarize(med_price = median(price, na_rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = room_type,
    values_from = med_price
  )

```
